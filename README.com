Absolutely ‚Äî here's a clear explanation you can use in your README that explains the creative and technical choices, including the HSB hue encoding and its limitation:

### üé® Hue Encoded Bifurcation Plot

This sketch visualizes the **logistic map bifurcation diagram**, a classic representation of how simple nonlinear systems can evolve into chaotic behavior. Each point on the canvas represents a value generated by the logistic equation:

```js
x = r * x * (1 - x);
```

where `r` varies horizontally from `startx` to `stopx`, and the vertical axis maps the resulting `x` values.

### üåà Temporal Hue Encoding

A key feature of this visualization is the use of **HSB hue** to encode the **iteration time** when each point was calculated.

* The color of each point corresponds to **when** it was generated during the iterative process (after transients have died out).
* Points generated **earlier** in the iteration loop are drawn with **lower hue values** (e.g. red), and those generated **later** use **higher hue values** (e.g. violet).
* This creates a **rainbow-like spectrum** within each vertical slice of the bifurcation diagram, visually encoding the temporal dimension of the attractor's structure.

```js
let hueVal = map(i, 101, 200, 1, 359); // i = iteration step
stroke(hueVal, 100, 100, 100);         // HSB mode
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitation: Final Color Bias in Periodic Regions

One limitation of this technique is especially visible in the **non-chaotic (periodic) regions** of the plot:

* In these regions, the logistic map settles into a **fixed point or small repeating cycle**.
* Since each new iteration lands on the **same values**, the **last hue used in the loop is the one that gets drawn repeatedly**.
* As a result, vertical lines in stable regions appear to be **a single hue** (typically near the end of the color range), even though earlier iterations may have landed on the same values.

This means **color is not evenly distributed** in non-chaotic regions, making it appear as if all the values occurred ‚Äúlate‚Äù ‚Äî even though they didn't.
